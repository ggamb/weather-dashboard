# Weather Dashboard


## Repository Description
This repository is a weather dashboard made in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML completely from scratch. To use this dashboard, type in the name of a city in the search bar and the current weather including the city's name, temperatue, wind speed, humidity and UV Index and five day forecast will populate from data from Open Weather API. The current weather dashboard will also color code the quality of the UV Index. After using the search, your results will appear below the search bar and remain persitent across usages.

## Challenge Reflection

This is my first time working with server-side APIs and I enjoyed messing around with the response from the Open Weather API and maniuplating the console to figure out what and how to get the data I needed. I also had to learn how to chain API calls to get both the current weather and five day forecast to work as intended. All in all, I enjoyed working with server-side APIs and will be sure to incorporate other server-side APIs going forward.
